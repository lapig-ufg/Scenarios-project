The Project's central objective was to project scenarios of agricultural intensification and remnant conservation, simulating future deforestation in the Amazon, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes as a function of pasture and soy expansion. Concurrently, the analysis of avoided deforestation was one of the goals for understanding the dynamics that drive land-use transitions. This is a joint initiative between the Image Processing and Geoprocessing Laboratory (LAPIG - UFG) and The Nature Conservancy.
